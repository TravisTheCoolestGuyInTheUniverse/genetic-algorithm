Description: given a population size and a dollar amount
at the command line, this program will first generate a population composed of
individuals made up of Quarters, Dimes, Nickels and Pennies that add up to the
specified dollar amount. Then the program will "breed" using the fittest individuals
until there is a generation that has an individual with the least amount
of coins possible that still adds up to the dollar amount.

To run: py geneticV4.py [population size (integer)] [dollar amount (float)]
